## What is Bitcoin?
    Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a globally decentralised network, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions
    without the need for intermediaries like banks and financial institutions. It is absolutely scarce - there are only 21 million Bitcoins and     it is often referred to as "Digital Gold". It uses Proof-of-Work algorithm to create an incorruptible, immutable ledger called the Bitcoin      blockchain which securely records all Bitcoin transactions in the world. 

## What gives Bitcoin value?
    Bitcoin's value comes from a combination of factors. The biggest reason is its Scarcity, as there will only ever be
    21 million Bitcoins in existence. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature, meaning it is not controlled by any
    central bank, government, or corporation, gives it value as it is not subject to inflationary monetary policies which causes debasement in      value of other currencies. Bitcoin also has utility as a censorship-resistant form of money and method of payments allowing for peer-to-peer
    transactions and cross-border transfers. Increasing adoption every year by individuals, businesses, and institutions as a form of        investment and payment method is driving to its value.

## Why should I care about Bitcoin?/ Why was Bitcoin invented?
    Bitcoin is sound money. It was created in the backdrop of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and in response to the
    inflationary monetary policies by the government and central banks, and the systemic risks of all Fiat/centralized
    currencies which are currently all national currencies in the world. Bitcoin is mathematically guaranteed to have absolute
    scarcity- 21 million- and offers several benefits such as financial freedom, privacy, and the ability to send and receive
    money globally without counterparty risk, ie, the need for a third party. It has all the properties required to be Money 
    and is growing in its acceptance every year. It also serves as a hedge against inflation and a store of value
    in times of economic uncertainty.

## Is Bitcoin useful for me?
    Bitcoin can be useful for a variety of purposes. If you are interested in financial privacy, permission-less global
    payments, investing in a new growing asset class, or participating in a decentralized form of money, Bitcoin is for you. 
    It's important to research and understand the risks and benefits before using Bitcoin for your specific needs.

## Can Bitcoin get hacked?
    Bitcoin itself, the network, cannot be hacked because it has no central point of failure. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer
    flat network with no hierarchy between full nodes, with all transactions publicly verifiable and the validating software 
    free and open-source. It uses game theory and strong cryptographic protocols to defend against brute-force attacks. 
    A brute-force attack to invalidate valid Bitcoin blocks requires 51% of the computation power of the network, which is
    extremely difficult to obtain, and such an attack cannot be sustained for long before the news of the attack will allow
    the rest of the network to respond with more computation. The exchanges or wallets used to store and manage Bitcoin
    private keys necessary to spend the specific Bitcoin, on the other hand, is vulnerable to hacks if not properly secured.
    It's crucial to use reputable wallets with strong security measures for securing your private keys to minimize the risk
    of hacking.

## Is Bitcoin illegal?
    Laws regarding Bitcoin's use varies from country to country. Bitcoin is NOT illegal in most countries, although there are
    restrictions or regulations surrounding its use like user identification(KYC), tax liability, anti-money laundering
    licensing for exchanges and businesses.

## Can the government ban Bitcoin?
    Governments have the ability to regulate or restrict the use of Bitcoin within their jurisdictions, but outright banning 
    Bitcoin is challenging due to its decentralized nature and use of privacy-preserving tools and services.
    Some countries have implemented regulations that govern the use of Bitcoin, such as licensing requirements for exchanges
    or anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. However, banning Bitcoin entirely is difficult since it is a global digital
    currency that operates on a decentralized network.

## How is the price of Bitcoin calculated?
    The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand in the markets where people buy and sell Bitcoin. It is typically
    calculated by the average price at which Bitcoin is being bought and sold across various exchanges around the world.

## What determines the price of Bitcoin? Why is it volatile?
    Since the price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand dynamics in the market, factors such as trading volume, 
    market demand, adoption, and macroeconomic factors can influence the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's price can be highly 
    volatile due to various factors, including investor sentiment, changes in regulations, and political events. Its relatively
    small market size compared to traditional financial markets also contributes to price volatility. Statistically, the
    magnitude of volatility is decreasing with each subsequent year thanks to growing adoption.

## I have heard that Bitcoin is not good for the environment?
    Bitcoin mining, the process of verifying transactions on the network and finding a valid block, does require significant 
    computational power and energy consumption. However, in the last few years due to ongoing efforts to make Bitcoin mining 
    more sustainable, such as the use of renewable energy source have made the majority of its operations sustainable.

## Is Bitcoin private?
    Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning they are recorded on the blockchain with a unique Bitcoin address, with no
    correlation with the identity of the owner. However, transactions can be traced back to a user's identity through 
    additional information or metadata if bought and sold using KYC ramps. It's important to take appropriate measures to 
    protect your privacy when using Bitcoin.

## Is Bitcoin accepted anywhere?
    While Bitcoin is not yet accepted everywhere, its acceptance as a form of payment is growing. Many online and offline 
    merchants, including major companies, now accept Bitcoin as a payment option. Acceptance varies depending on the
    region or country.

## What is the best way to acquire Bitcoin?
    There are several ways to acquire Bitcoin. You can buy it from a reputable exchange using fiat currency, run your own 
    mining operations, buy from a trusted seller directly, or receive it as payment for goods or services. It's important
    to do your research, choose a reliable method suited to your needs and preferences, and follow proper security measures
    when acquiring Bitcoin.

# Security and Self-Custody

## How do I secure my Bitcoin?
    Securing your Bitcoin involves getting it off exchanges, self-custody of your funds, using a reputable wallet, backing up
    your private keys in an offline and secure location, regularly updating your software and devices with the latest security
    patches, and being cautious about entering the correct address when spending it. Security is not a black and white thing 
    and it will differ according to an individual's technical proficiency, amount of funds, backup methods etc. It is advised
    to practice security one step at a time, gaining proficiency and following the process judiciously. 

## What is Self-Custody?
    Self-custody is the practice of securing and holding your own Bitcoin without reying on a third-party intermediary, such 
    as a bank or exchange, to store or control your Bitcoin. With self-custody, you have full control over your Bitcoin 
    private keys using your Seed Phrase, which is the unique sequence of words(12/24) that allows you to access and transfer
    your Bitcoin. Self-custody is at the core of invention of Bitcoin, as it empowers the individual to have ownership and
    control over their money, without the need for intermediaries.

## Why should I Self-Custody Bitcoin?
    Self-custody of Bitcoin provides you with greater control and ownership of your funds. By holding and managing your own
    Bitcoin private keys, you eliminate the need to rely on third-party intermediaries, such as exchanges or wallets, which
    are vulnerable to security breaches, hacks, fractional reserves, restricted access, censoring transactions, seizing funds
    etc. Self-custody allows you to be the sole custodian of your Bitcoin, ensuring that you have full control and
    permissionl-ess access to your funds, protecting your privacy and financial sovereignty.

## What is Seed phrase?
    The Seed phrase is a unique sequence of 12 or 24 words that is used to backup and recover a Bitcoin Wallet on any device.
    It is generated by the wallet and is used to derive private-public key pairs which are used to send and receive bitcoins
    on your wallet. Whoever is in possession of this sequence of words controls the bitcoin on the wallet, ie, is the owner
    of the Bitcoin.

## What is a passphrase?
    A Passphrase is an optional word or phrase attached to your Seed phrase as an additional source of entropy and security.
    Passphrases help you recover your funds in case the security of your seed is compromised. Passphrases are also useful to
    create multiple wallets to hold different amounts of funds. For example, someone might have some of their funds on a 
    wallet secured by their seed, and have other amounts on wallets secured by the seed + passphrases like 'Life-Savings',
    'Recreation', 'Decoy', 'Emergency funds' etc. 

## Which wallet should I use?
    While there are many standard wallets available as options, every wallet comes with its own set of pros and cons, 
    trade-offs, ease-of-use, security etc. It is critical that the user chooses one among the standard wallets, ie, wallets
    that are open-source, reputable and battle-field tested for security. There are two types of wallets - Hot Wallets, which
    store your keys on a device which can connect to the internet(mobile and desktop) and Cold Wallets, which store your keys
    on a device which never connects to the internet, ie, air-gapped. Some secure wallets with good reputation are - 
    Blue Wallet, Wasabi, ColdCard. 

## Why Bitcoin-only?
    Bitcoin-only is the philosophy of realising Bitcoin's value. It is based on understanding that Bitcoin is the only 
    currency in the world with absolute scarcity, verifiability, and decentralisation. Bitcoin has unique characteristics that makes
    it sound money, outside of the control of any government, corporations, or group of individuals. It uses Proof-of-Work
    algorithm as its primary security feature to arrive at consensus and create an immutable ledger of secure transactions.
    Since Bitcoin's inceptions, there have been many charlatans coming up with competing altcoins in attempts
    to cheat the investors.
